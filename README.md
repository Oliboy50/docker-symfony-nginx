Docker - Symfony VM
===
**Build a local Virtual Machine (Docker aware) which allows you to run a Symfony full stack application in Ubuntu container on any OS (including Windows/Mac)**


## Requirements

 - [msysgit](https://msysgit.github.io/) **for Windows user only** (see ["Get a nice terminal"](#get-a-nice-terminal-and-be-able-to-use-git-and-many-useful-unix-commands-on-windows) section below if you don't know how to do)
 - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
 - [Docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/#installation) ([version 0.3.0+](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases)) => just an executable to rename `docker-machine` and to move somewhere in your `PATH`


## What's inside?

### docker-machine-dev(.bat/.sh)
A simple yet powerful script that use Docker Machine to build a local Docker aware VM without even installing Docker. 
It's also used to set some useful aliases in the VM (such as`docker-compose` which run Docker Compose in a container).

### Dockerfile
 - Miscellaneous useful tools (`nano`, `vim`, `curl`, `wget`, etc.)
 - Nginx (including a default site configuration for Symfony app)
 - PHP 5.6 with FPM and Composer
 - Ruby and Python (could be needed to use some dependencies)
 - NodeJS 0.12 with `bower`, `gulp` and `grunt`

### docker-entrypoint.sh
This file is the default ENTRYPOINT of the image. It will be executed each time you run this container. This is where you should put all your project specific stuffs that could help you building a perfect Symfony application (e.g. run services, run a Makefile, etc.).

### docker-compose.yml
This file (using Docker-compose) will help you to build a perfect environment for your Symfony app by running and linking several containers the way you want using a single command. 
Keep in mind that this could also be done using many long `docker` commands without the need of `docker-compose` at all.


## How to use?

### First time

 1. Clone this repository in a new folder (let's name it `docker`) **at the root of your Symfony application sources**, with:
`git clone https://github.com/Oliboy50/docker-symfony-vm.git docker`

 2. Go to the new folder `cd docker` and type `docker-machine-dev`
If you followed the [Requirements](#requirements), after a few seconds you will be given access to the VM where you will be able to run `docker` commands

 3. Now that you are in your VM, you can "install" `docker-compose` with: 
`install-docker-compose`
 
 4. Then, again, `cd` to the new folder in your Symfony project (the VM shared your `C:\Users\` (windows) or `/Users/` (mac) folder as `/c/Users/` or `/Users/` --- see [complete reference here](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker#virtualbox-guest-additions)) 
 
 5. Build and run the whole Symfony environment with:
`docker-compose-web` 
(this is just an alias for `docker-compose run --service-ports web`)

 6. If everything worked you should be able to see your Symfony application running in your host browser at 192.168.99.100 (you can check if it is the correct IP by running `docker-machine ip dev` in your host terminal)

### Second time and more

    # Host terminal
    cd C:\Users\mySymfonyApp\docker
    docker-machine-dev
    # VM terminal
    cd /c/Users/mySymfonyApp/docker
    docker-compose-web


## Get a nice terminal and be able to use Git and many useful UNIX commands on Windows

 1. Install `msysgit` http://msysgit.github.io/ (bottom of the page)

 2. Install `Cmder` http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder/ (mini version without msysgit)

 3. Add the following directories at the very beginning of the `PATH` environment variable (could be different if you chose a different installation path for msysgit): 
`C:\msysgit\bin;C:\msysgit\mingw\bin;C:\msysgit\cmd;`

 4. I'd also recommend to always run `Cmder` as an Administrator (right click => Properties, etc.). 

**ProTips**: One of the many nice things you can do with Cmder is setting persistent aliases such as `alias cd-docker=cd "C:\path\to\my\sf_project\docker"` =). To view and manage your aliases, edit the file located at `C:\cmder_installation_directory\config\aliases`.


## WTF!? You're using a Docker container as a VM!?
Indeed, I could have split this big image in many smaller images (i.e. PHP5.6 linked with PHP-FPM linked with NGINX linked with NodeJS linked with Ruby, etc.) but I just wanted to keep it really simple and independent from the host OS. 
This is meant to be a fast deployable development environment nothing else.
